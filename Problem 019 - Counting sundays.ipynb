    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward approach to the problem is to simply iterate over the days between the start and end points, checking whether each is a Sunday and then incrementing the count if so. This method would have a running time proportional to the size of the date range being checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "An improvement could be made by skipping ahead by the number of dates in each month, as the first day of each month is only one in which we are interested. This still has a running time proportional to the length of the range, but reduces the number of iterations by a constant fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, instead of checking candidate dates, we could start from the first known Sunday that falls on the first of the month and then add month totals until the sum is a multiple of 7 (assuring that the first of the corresponding month would also be a Sunday) and then jump to that date. This is the second approach implemented below. Like skipping from first to first, the running time is still proportional to the size of the date range, but reduced by a constant fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because the pattern of dates and days of the week is regular, over a long enough time period it would be possible to calculate the total without iterating over the whole range. However, the pattern has a period too long to be used as a whole. A sub pattern (applicable to ranges of times that do not cross over years divisible by 400) could be used, however. Even in a four-year leap year cycle there are $365 \\cdot 3 + 366 = 1461$ days, and to find a cycle after which we end up on the same day, we would need to find a multiple of this period which is divisible by 7 (the number of days of the week). $1461\\bmod 7 = 5$, so that cycle must be 7 four-year periods long or 28 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would mean that we can calculate the number of Sundays on the first in the first 28 year period, multiply this by 3 to find the total for the first 84 years, and then calculate and add the remaining total (from 1985 to the end of the century). This is only a very small improvement on the second method for the range in question."
