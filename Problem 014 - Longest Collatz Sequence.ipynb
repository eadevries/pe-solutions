    "\n",
    "n → n/2 (n is even)  \n",
    "n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.\n",

    "Four slightly different approaches are shown below. The first of these simply tracks the current value and adds up the number of steps taken until the value reaches 1. The second is the same except that it uses a cache dictionary so that previously computed values can be looked up instead of recomputed. The third approach tracks the entirety of the sequence until the last entry is 1, and then computes its length. Finally, the fourth approach combines tracking the sequence as a whole with a cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the values in question, the simplest approach (counting the number of steps for each starting number individually) is in fact the fastest of the approaches considered, with the others adding almost 50% to the running time. It appears that the dict lookups/assignments added more time to the total than was saved by avoiding duplication of work. Passing the entire sequence and appending to it likewise did not save any time."
